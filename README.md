# Helper functions

This repository contains a bunch of helper functions that I find myself constantly rewriting for my
projects.

## Concept

- I decided not to implement this as a gist as I'd like to add automated tests for some functions in
  the future.
- I also decided for this to not be a package as I don't want to worry about dependency management
  (and also because I'd like to have more languages here than Typescript).
- There's probably great pre-existing alternatives for most of what I add here ([lodash](https://lodash.com/)
  would be an obvious example). Part of my reasoning for doing it this way is that I enjoy writing
  the code, and another reason is that it makes it easy to avoid "pulling in another package".

## Contributing

This is for my personal use, so I'm not really looking for anyone to add new functions. That said,
I'd encourage others to use this code or fork it to add their own functions. Issues
for any bugs are welcome, and I'd love to hear from you if you find these functions useful and use
them in your own projects!
